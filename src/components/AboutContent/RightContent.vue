    I'm Ana Elisa, 29 years-old, living in Bras√≠lia-DF in Brazil. I majored in
    energy engineering and then decided to hop into the tech world. Found my
    passion in coding along the years and now I'm working as a back-end
    developer while studying as a graduate student in System Analyst and
    Developement.
