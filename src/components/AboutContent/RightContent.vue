    I'm Ana Elisa, 29 years-old, living in Bras√≠lia-DF in Brazil. I majored in
    energy engineering before I entered into the tech world and found my
    passion in coding along the years. Currently, I'm working as a back-end
    developer while studying as a graduate student in System Analysis and
    Development.
